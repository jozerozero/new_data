download_data_path/process_wavs/43.wav	but there's just no answer to that yet

download_data_path/process_wavs/61.wav	The Institute has already begun ambitious large-scale human trials have its own potential vaccine

download_data_path/process_wavs/118.wav	the Commissioners have a tough job they're weighing a lot of things and making the decision of how and when to get back to work

download_data_path/process_wavs/37.wav	when we get to that point we may start to slowly open things back up

download_data_path/process_wavs/32.wav	pretty early on dr. volkov became concerned about how this pandemic would affect those struggling with substance abuse

download_data_path/process_wavs/116.wav	but there are scientists All Around the World in Labs we're working at different treatments to treat the virus itself and hopefully by the summer you may have some good answers on that

download_data_path/process_wavs/151.wav	he didn't know he was positive at the time and later apologized for it

download_data_path/process_wavs/87.wav	according to Nielsen sales of alcoholic beverages increased 55% in the last week of March compared to the same time last year

download_data_path/process_wavs/71.wav	and of course even a date that far ahead doesn't come without concerns

download_data_path/process_wavs/120.wav	even though you can't see these germs were these viruses they are all over the place there on door handle sometimes are on your toys

download_data_path/process_wavs/139.wav	she said she hasn't seen anything like this in her entire career

download_data_path/process_wavs/40.wav	and what that might mean for us here in the United States

download_data_path/process_wavs/35.wav	if it works it'll teach her body to recognize the coronavirus has spiky looking proteins and then make antibodies to fight it

download_data_path/process_wavs/114.wav	and while there isn't any data showing how the pandemic has impacted rates of alcohol use disorder people do appear to be buying a lot of alcohol

download_data_path/process_wavs/23.wav	League employees spouses and players volunteer to participate to help give a better understanding of how prevalent is virus really is

download_data_path/process_wavs/156.wav	that's right Carl and I think it's also important remember that when you wear a mask it's to help protect other people from you

download_data_path/process_wavs/56.wav	yep right now the only medications for this coronavirus are ones that help treat your symptoms

download_data_path/process_wavs/107.wav	phase 3 gathers data on whether the vaccine really protect people in real life situations

download_data_path/process_wavs/86.wav	he's also had some practice Sean was involved in a 2017 trial for an Ebola vaccine

download_data_path/process_wavs/52.wav	dr. pouty said they didn't take that risk with the mosquito-borne zika virus when it threatened the United States in 2016

download_data_path/process_wavs/160.wav	the program was ended and lawsuits flooded the federal government

download_data_path/process_wavs/74.wav	at least 45 people in Atlanta and Seattle have received an injection of the vaccine which is called mRNA - 1 2 7 3

download_data_path/process_wavs/101.wav	can you limit the number of customers

download_data_path/process_wavs/48.wav	I even had tickets to the final four this year so I was really disappointed when that didn't happen

download_data_path/process_wavs/159.wav	Major League Baseball is now participating in a nationwide coronavirus antibody study

download_data_path/process_wavs/149.wav	and what does that mean for you

download_data_path/process_wavs/22.wav	phase one looks at whether the vaccine is safe for a few people

download_data_path/process_wavs/125.wav	it was the day President Trump announced the travel restrictions from Europe the day Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson said they had tested positive for covid-19

download_data_path/process_wavs/161.wav	but I got some amazing questions from you and I'm going to try and answer them the best I can

download_data_path/process_wavs/9.wav	some scientist want to speed up this process even further with what's called a human challenge trial that would purposely expose people to covid-19 to test the efficacy of a vaccine

download_data_path/process_wavs/51.wav	but how will we in the United States get back to normal or at least closer to it

download_data_path/process_wavs/97.wav	what we're not entirely sure about is exactly how it got into humans

download_data_path/process_wavs/39.wav	but the government could direct manufacturers to begin producing a vaccine before it is gone through all three phases and has been fully tested

download_data_path/process_wavs/41.wav	right now Sydney one of the most promising things out there is that scientists are working on finding a vaccine

download_data_path/process_wavs/0.wav	it could be that the bat made another animal sick and then that animal got a human sick or it could be that it's spread directly from bats to humans

download_data_path/process_wavs/123.wav	most of us remember that day

download_data_path/process_wavs/136.wav	have you ever seen anything quite like what we're seeing now in terms of this Collective moment of Dreams

download_data_path/process_wavs/141.wav	they're obviously significant health concerns

download_data_path/process_wavs/109.wav	vaccine development usually happens in three phases

download_data_path/process_wavs/137.wav	we still don't know yet

download_data_path/process_wavs/18.wav	at least 30 people died after receiving the vaccine in about 450 more developed Guillain-Barre syndrome

download_data_path/process_wavs/99.wav	with so many people isolating during this pandemic on their own Anthony worries that those who struggle with substance abuse are especially vulnerable

download_data_path/process_wavs/165.wav	that's a medicine that can help teach your body how to fight the virus

download_data_path/process_wavs/147.wav	remember even if you're not sick even if you're not coughing or sneezing if you have the virus inside your body you could possibly spread it to others

download_data_path/process_wavs/102.wav	Magic Johnson also remains hopeful

download_data_path/process_wavs/53.wav	Christine Brennan has been covering sports for three decades

download_data_path/process_wavs/20.wav	because of this the CDC is issued new guidelines to ensure the workers health and safety including setting up barriers between workers

download_data_path/process_wavs/131.wav	but the threat to our health and safety was too great

download_data_path/process_wavs/29.wav	but this week President Trump still signed an executive order compelling meat processing plants to remain open

download_data_path/process_wavs/162.wav	it outlines for steps for containing the virus testing isolating contact tracing and quarantining

download_data_path/process_wavs/126.wav	people like Shawn are the only way vaccines can be proven effective for the population at Large

download_data_path/process_wavs/157.wav	his life's work is in HIV research but he's now doing work on covid-19 treatments and a vaccine

download_data_path/process_wavs/12.wav	Olympic runner Alby Abby Ramon thinks that the 2021 Olympics will be a history-making record-breaking year

download_data_path/process_wavs/93.wav	make sure everyone is keeping a safe distance

download_data_path/process_wavs/45.wav	dr. Del Rio is an infectious disease expert and a professor of medicine and Global Health at Emory University where I am also on staff

download_data_path/process_wavs/63.wav	listen to what you're saying it does seem like short of a vaccine we are going to be at this for a while

download_data_path/process_wavs/55.wav	meanwhile scientist overseas are equally hopeful

download_data_path/process_wavs/150.wav	but there's been a lot of debate surrounding those decisions

download_data_path/process_wavs/115.wav	after 76 days on April 8th the lockdown was lifted in Wuhan and people can now leave their neighborhoods

download_data_path/process_wavs/58.wav	dr. Evan Anderson is the lead investigator for the Emory University based arm of this trial

download_data_path/process_wavs/148.wav	many of us still haven't been able to settle into a new routine

download_data_path/process_wavs/154.wav	it is also possible that the bats were studied in a lab and then the virus spread to humans that way

download_data_path/process_wavs/100.wav	and it wasn't just the safety of the fans it was for the safety of the athletes to

download_data_path/process_wavs/65.wav	scientist hope that Sean's blood and that of other volunteers holds the key to unlocking a covid-19 weapon for the rest of us

download_data_path/process_wavs/10.wav	as I said earlier President Trump has asked Major League Sports Commissioners to be a part of that conversation

download_data_path/process_wavs/104.wav	since January people like Doug have been in lockdown some residents haven't been allowed to leave their homes or gated communities for months

download_data_path/process_wavs/8.wav	the games have been canceled three times before but this is the first time they've been postponed

download_data_path/process_wavs/1.wav	the country's largest meat packing Union estimates that 20 workers have died of the virus and at least 6,000 additional members have been impacted by it

download_data_path/process_wavs/84.wav	at 43 he's also the oldest American to run the marathon in the Olympics

download_data_path/process_wavs/69.wav	and because of the risks there aren't any challenge trials underway right now

download_data_path/process_wavs/108.wav	background is actually a bunch of little spikes that the virus uses to move around and to get inside the body

download_data_path/process_wavs/94.wav	the Food and Drug Administration has advised that those who smoke cigarettes may be at increased risk and have worse outcomes from the virus

download_data_path/process_wavs/142.wav	if all goes well researchers say they could have a million doses ready by September

download_data_path/process_wavs/11.wav	the national pork board is estimating that one and a half million Hogs will have to be killed in the coming weeks

download_data_path/process_wavs/17.wav	Shawn received his first dose of the vaccine in March at Emory University Hospital

download_data_path/process_wavs/121.wav	it is hard to believe that we're sort of in this self quarantine on Earth Day

download_data_path/process_wavs/140.wav	but of course public health comes first

download_data_path/process_wavs/128.wav	but here's the thing connecting online may not be enough for everyone

download_data_path/process_wavs/112.wav	he's one of a small handful of people in the United States testing a possible vaccine for covid-19

download_data_path/process_wavs/25.wav	well three of the country's largest pork processing plants are closing indefinitely because of outbreaks in the workforce

download_data_path/process_wavs/88.wav	three clear Chinese officials have warned that they still have to be cautious and control measures will remain in place

download_data_path/process_wavs/133.wav	you may remember gobert as the player who touched all the microphones at a Utah Jazz media event as a prank

download_data_path/process_wavs/66.wav	together they're going through the country's food supply chain link by link from Farmers to food banks to answer the question is the food supply chain breaking

download_data_path/process_wavs/113.wav	fortunately she says there have already been some changes to the way care is provided for those with substance use disorders

download_data_path/process_wavs/68.wav	one thing we need to make sure we can do is start to test people for the virus letting them know whether they have it in their bodies and making sure that if they do they don't spread it to other people

download_data_path/process_wavs/158.wav	it's not just illicit substances that pose a threat during this pandemic but legal ones as well because covid-19 impacts the lungs

download_data_path/process_wavs/153.wav	11000 Olympians expected to compete in Tokyo this summer have had their plans put on hold

download_data_path/process_wavs/3.wav	joining me today to help address some of these concerns is dr. Carlos Del Rio

download_data_path/process_wavs/81.wav	we don't want to repeat the same mistakes made in 1976 when the government rushed to get the flu vaccine without proper testing

download_data_path/process_wavs/92.wav	instead of using the actual virus which could make a volunteer sick this vaccine relies on mRNA or messenger RNA

download_data_path/process_wavs/59.wav	what major league baseball is hoping to open it season in May according to ESPN

download_data_path/process_wavs/57.wav	20/20 was the fifth time he's qualified

download_data_path/process_wavs/91.wav	it all seems to come back to testing

download_data_path/process_wavs/111.wav	he told CNN this weekend that his best case scenario would be for large-scale manufacturing to begin within a year but only if everything goes perfectly

download_data_path/process_wavs/152.wav	do you make everyone wear a mask not to mention how will each decision ultimately affect your bottom line

download_data_path/process_wavs/135.wav	and while there has been some criticism of that designation doctor volkoff points out that having access to alcohol could in some situations be safer for alcoholics

download_data_path/process_wavs/49.wav	this coronavirus is called coronavirus because Corona means Crown so this looks like a little blob with a crown on top of it

download_data_path/process_wavs/6.wav	Anthony is an alcoholic who has been in recovery for 7 years

download_data_path/process_wavs/60.wav	last week is non-profit released a plan for reopening society called box it in

download_data_path/process_wavs/33.wav	we spoke to an English teacher in Wuhan China where the outbreak is believed to have started

download_data_path/process_wavs/28.wav	the 2020 Summer Games now postponed until 2021

download_data_path/process_wavs/82.wav	but Anthony B who's been in recovery for 7 years worries about the Temptation for people who are still struggling

download_data_path/process_wavs/19.wav	I know I've had a hard time with it myself

download_data_path/process_wavs/95.wav	why are we experiencing this Collective moment of bizarre dreams is there a role that anxiety is playing

download_data_path/process_wavs/78.wav	in 1976 when a new virus the so-called swine flu began spreading in New Jersey the United States feared it could lead to a pandemic like the 1918 flu

download_data_path/process_wavs/134.wav	I wish I could tell you I knew exactly when you could go back to having play dates and learning from your teachers in person

download_data_path/process_wavs/44.wav	she's been covering the food and agriculture industry for the network

download_data_path/process_wavs/4.wav	think of that as the genetic blueprint of the virus

download_data_path/process_wavs/138.wav	Christine Brennan predicts that that won't happen at the PGA men's golf tournament when it comes back in June and the Masters in November

download_data_path/process_wavs/96.wav	our conversation though started on a personal note the birth of his son 15 days ago

download_data_path/process_wavs/143.wav	normally methadone can only be prescribed after an in-person evaluation and must be taken in the clinic

download_data_path/process_wavs/38.wav	there's also the possibility that spectator less Sports will become The New Normal

download_data_path/process_wavs/64.wav	that's Deirdre Barrett my psychologist in dream researcher at Harvard University

download_data_path/process_wavs/13.wav	now the federal government is slowly making plans to reopen the country

download_data_path/process_wavs/110.wav	such an the thing about germs and viruses like this is that they are too small for us to see or feel even on her skin

download_data_path/process_wavs/79.wav	together these plants make up about 15% of Court production

download_data_path/process_wavs/2.wav	it makes it less likely that you can spread the germs from you to somebody else

download_data_path/process_wavs/24.wav	a vaccine was rushed into development

download_data_path/process_wavs/73.wav	the doctor about she said they are doing so safely

download_data_path/process_wavs/75.wav	I have someone who is no stranger to epidemics

download_data_path/process_wavs/103.wav	when he was in the throes of addiction most of his substance abuse took place at home alone

download_data_path/process_wavs/16.wav	Microsoft founder Bill Gates is funding seven efforts to find a safe and effective vaccine

download_data_path/process_wavs/21.wav	she's currently conducting a dream survey around covid-19 dreams

download_data_path/process_wavs/127.wav	so I asked Deirdre why do we dream

download_data_path/process_wavs/34.wav	I'm a huge basketball fan myself so I was crushed when I heard the news of the NBA suspension

download_data_path/process_wavs/62.wav	and while many Georgia businesses reopen following rules of a new normal there are still plenty of questions

download_data_path/process_wavs/30.wav	but that doesn't mean that scientists haven't been able to use microscopes and get a good look at them

download_data_path/process_wavs/155.wav	at a briefing last month White House coronavirus Task Force member dr. Anthony falchi explained why he's willing to take this risk

download_data_path/process_wavs/76.wav	even if things continue at such a fast pace it could be a year or even more before a vaccine for covid-19 is widely available

download_data_path/process_wavs/27.wav	and the Sports World Isn't just waiting on the sidelines in the midst of the pandemic

download_data_path/process_wavs/145.wav	I wanted to talk to Deirdre about what's happening to our minds during this Global crisis and what we can do to manage the stress better

download_data_path/process_wavs/15.wav	what are things going to be like this summer

download_data_path/process_wavs/98.wav	as a student of the brain I've always been fascinated with dreams

download_data_path/process_wavs/105.wav	now trials for a covid-19 vaccine began less than a month after the virus's genome was first sequenced in early January

download_data_path/process_wavs/46.wav	he told me that the injection of the potential covid-19 into his arm was pretty mild

download_data_path/process_wavs/164.wav	Sports as we know it may not be the same for a long time

download_data_path/process_wavs/83.wav	we agreed not to use his last name to protect his privacy

download_data_path/process_wavs/163.wav	there's a lot for business owners to consider when thinking about reopening

download_data_path/process_wavs/129.wav	that's the reason you have to wash your hands a lot because when you use soap and water you can actually clean those germs off your hands even if you can't see it happening

download_data_path/process_wavs/72.wav	that's one of the hardest things about life during this time not having answers

download_data_path/process_wavs/117.wav	that may be partly as a result of liquor stores being deemed essential businesses in most States

download_data_path/process_wavs/146.wav	but this is a first so far no such vaccine has ever been approved for use on the General Public

download_data_path/process_wavs/54.wav	now he's the president of resolve to save lives a non-profit initiative that aims to make the world safer from epidemics

download_data_path/process_wavs/47.wav	things to looks at whether it's safe for more people and test various dosage amounts to see if it's effective

download_data_path/process_wavs/36.wav	the vaccine Sean Doyle is helping test out is currently in Phase 1

download_data_path/process_wavs/124.wav	and now scientists around the world are hard at work

download_data_path/process_wavs/14.wav	that kind of disruption to can take a toll especially for those who were in the process of trying to make a change in their lives

download_data_path/process_wavs/90.wav	after the NBA suspended It season it was like a domino effect

download_data_path/process_wavs/31.wav	when an announcer called off the Oklahoma City Thunder and Utah Jazz game just before tip-off

download_data_path/process_wavs/42.wav	so if you have a cough runny nose or a fever there certain medicines that can help with that

download_data_path/process_wavs/50.wav	we got to make sure that in different places around the country things are headed in the right direction that there are fewer people getting sick that more people can get tested

download_data_path/process_wavs/130.wav	and the NCAA canceled its spring and winter championships

download_data_path/process_wavs/67.wav	it was the day President Trump announced the travel restrictions from Europe the day Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson said they had tested positive for covid-19

download_data_path/process_wavs/144.wav	so what's going on here

download_data_path/process_wavs/70.wav	the league plans to start its regular season in September and the draft help set that into motion

download_data_path/process_wavs/77.wav	but soon devastating side effects began to emerge

download_data_path/process_wavs/85.wav	major league soccer in the NHL has suspended their seasons for now

download_data_path/process_wavs/119.wav	I spoke with Daniel Eichner the president and lab director of the sports medicine research and testing Laboratory

download_data_path/process_wavs/106.wav	that's a neurological disorder that can lead to paralysis

download_data_path/process_wavs/26.wav	well there are unknown risks for the early trial volunteers it would be even riskier to skip these important testing stages

download_data_path/process_wavs/89.wav	that raises ethical questions as well

download_data_path/process_wavs/7.wav	when I spoke with Sean he said his family and friends were nervous about his involvement with experimental medicine but ultimately they trusted his instincts as a medical student

download_data_path/process_wavs/80.wav	so efforts to find a vaccine for covid-19 are moving much faster

download_data_path/process_wavs/132.wav	I love March Madness it's one of my favorite times of the year

download_data_path/process_wavs/5.wav	by the time human trials for a vaccine showed promise the cases had dissipated there is still no vaccine available

download_data_path/process_wavs/122.wav	a mask helps prevent you from doing that
